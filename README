A jspm example that shows how multiple versions of a dependency live together


To run the react app locally

    npm install
    npm install jspm

    jspm install react=github:reactjs/react-bower -o "{main: 'react', format: 'global'}" -f
    jspm install react-nested-router=github:toranb/toranb-react-nested-router
    jspm install ajax-mixin=github:toranb/toranb-react-amd-rsvp-ajax-mixin

    (the below are optional depending on what you want to show)
    jspm install rsvp=github:tildeio/rsvp.js@3.0.6 -o "{main: 'lib/rsvp.js'}"
    jspm install rsvp=github:tildeio/rsvp.js@3.0.7 -o "{main: 'lib/rsvp.js'}"

    gulp

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

    visit http://localhost:3000 to see the running app


examples on what you can do w/ this app

    from the app.jsx pull in the helpers import
    add it as a mixin (above the render method)

    mixins: [AjaxReactComponent]

    next at the top of the render method invoke this.fire();

    This will pull in the RSVP dependency you added above

    If you used 3.0.7 and later click dashboard and inbox it
    shouldn't load 3.0.7 again

    If you instead did 3.0.6 you will notice that jspm will pull
    in RSVP 3.0.7 "on demand" when it's needed in inbox

    play around with other variations (ie- loading 3.0.7 on demand in dashboard)

    see if only the dashboard on demand loads 3.0.7 and once that is done...
    see if it will load 3.0.7 again when inbox is rendered (it shouldn't)
